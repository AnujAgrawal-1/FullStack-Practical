    <h3>About Course</h3>
    <p>
      Full stack web development is the practice of working on both the
      front-end and back-end of a program. It is a term mostly used for those
      working in web development. The developers have background on creating
      user interface and user experience for front-end, and also have strong
      knowledge in a programming language that is used for handling the logic of
      the application, hence back-end.[1] Full Stack is a layer of software or
      web development consisting of the front-end and the back-end portions of
      an application. Front-end is what the users will see or interact with on
      your application. Back-end part is what users do not see, such as
      application's logic, database, server, etc. A full-stack web developer is
      comfortable working with both back-end and front-end technologies which
      make a website or application function properly
